30. Rainbow-seq: combining cell division lineage tracking with single-cell RNA sequencing for understanding cell fate decision in preimplantation development
(Submitter supplied) Our main question is whether there are reproducible cell-to-cell transcriptome differences in 4-cell embryos that are attributable to their different progenitor cells at the 2-cell stage. If the answer is negative, we wish to test whether there are reproducible cell-to-cell transcriptome differences in 8-cell embryos that are attributable to their different progenitor cells at the 2-cell stage. To address these questions, we developed the Rainbow-seq method that uses fluorescent protein genes to trace cell divisions in preimplantation embryonic development (PED) embryos

(Submitter supplied) We recently reported that single-cell derived isogenic subclones of SKMEL5 cells have differential initial sensitivity to BRAF-inhibitors. In order to probe differences among these subclones, we selected three subclones with unique drug responses: progressing (SK-MEL-5 SC10), stationary (SK-MEL-5 SC07), and regressing (SK-MEL-5 SC01) and performed RNASeq. This study examines differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the subclones to identify the molecular basis for initial differences in drug sensitivity.

36. Single-cell RNA-seq of melanoma ecosystems reveals sources of T cells exclusion linked to immunotherapy clinical outcomes
(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) from 31 melanoma tumors and novel computational methods to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T cell exclusion and immune evasion. more...

77. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the mammalian pineal gland identifies two pinealocyte subtypes and cell type-specific daily patterns of gene expression  
(Submitter supplied) The vertebrate pineal gland is dedicated to the production of the hormone melatonin, which increases at night to influence circadian and seasonal rhythms.  This increase is associated with dramatic changes in the pineal transcriptome.  Here, single-cell analysis of the rat pineal transcriptome was approached by sequencing mRNA from ~17,000 individual pineal cells, with the goals of profiling the cells that comprise the pineal gland and examining the proposal that there are two distinct populations of pinealocytes differentiated by the expression of Asmt, which encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin. more...

113. SIS-seq, a molecular ‘time machine’, connects single cell fate with gene programs
(Submitter supplied) Conventional single cell RNA-seq methods are destructive, such that a given cell cannot also then be tested for fate and function, without a time machine. Here, we develop a clonal method SIS-seq, whereby single cells are allowed to divide, and progeny cells are assayed separately in SISter conditions; some for fate, others by RNA-seq. By cross-correlating fate and gene expression within a clone, and doing this for many clones, we can identify the earliest gene expression signatures of dendritic cell subset development. more...

118. Unique microglia recovery population revealed by single-cell RNAseq following neurodegeneration
(Submitter supplied) Microglia are brain immune cells that constantly survey their environment to maintain homeostasis. Enhanced microglial reactivity and proliferation are typical hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Whether specific disease-linked microglial subsets exist during the entire course of neurodegeneration, including the recovery phase, is currently unclear. Taking a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach in a susceptibility gene-free model of nerve injury, we identified a microglial subpopulation that upon acute neurodegeneration shares a conserved gene regulatory profile compared to previously reported chronic and destructive neurodegeneration transgenic mouse models. more...

124. Single-cell analysis reveals stochastic regulation of type I IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and identifies host-derived environmental cues as amplifier of type I IFN production
(Submitter supplied) Type I interferon (IFN) is a key driver of immunity to infections and cancer. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are uniquely equipped to produce large quantities of type I IFN but the mech-anisms that control this process are poorly understood. Here, we developed a droplet-based microfluidic platform and investigated type I IFN production in human pDCs at the single-cell level. We show that type I IFN but not TNF alpha production is limited to a small subpopulation of individually stimulated pDCs and controlled by stochastic gene regulation. more...

(Submitter supplied) We applied single-cell RNA-Seq to analyze human diseased arteries, and identified histone variant H2A.Z as a key histone signature to maintain vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) identity. We show that H2A.Z occupies genomic regions near VSMC marker genes and its occupancy is decreased in VSMC undergoing dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, H2A.Z occupancy preferentially promotes nucleosome turnover, facilitates the recruitment of Smad3 and Med1 to VSMC marker genes, thereby activating gene expression. more...

By massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq we comprehensively mapped the host lung response to in-vivo influenza infection in wild-type and Irf7-knockout mice across nine immune and non-immune cell types. We found an unexpected high prevalence of infected cells in all cell types, showed that infection is a characteristic property of cell types that is independent of type-I interferon activity, and demonstrated that all cell types responded primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response. more...

This remains highly controversial due to a lack of prospective in vivo labeling techniques that can effectively distinguish ependymal cells from neighboring V-SVZ NSCs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we report in vivo reprogramming of pancreatic ductal cells through intra-ductal delivery of an adenoviral vector expressing the transcription factors Pdx1, Neurog3 and Mafa (adPNM). To better understand the extent of reprogramming in induced pancreatic ductal cells, comparative single cell RNA sequencing was performed on insulin+ pancreatic ductal cells and pancreatic β-cells. Compared with pancreatic β cells, we show that insulin+ pancreatic ductal cells had established a β-cell gene expression program, albeit with immature features.

(Submitter supplied) Ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs are highly similar to embryonic stem cells and can be used for regenerative medicine, drug screening and disease modelling. Despite recent advances, reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process. This suggests that there are several safeguarding mechanisms to counteract cell fate conversion. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs are highly similar to embryonic stem cells and can be used for regenerative medicine, drug screening and disease modelling. Despite recent advances, reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process. This suggests that there are several safeguarding mechanisms to counteract cell fate conversion. more...

(Submitter supplied) In highly polarized cells such as neurons, compartmentalization of mRNA and of local protein synthesis enables remarkably fast, precise, and local responses to external stimuli. These responses are highly important for neuron growth cone guidance, synapse formation, and regeneration following injury. Because an altered spatial distribution of mRNA can result in mental retardation or neurodegenerative diseases, subcellular transcriptome analysis of neurons could be a useful tool for studying these conditions, but current techniques, such as in situ hybridization, bulk microarray, or RNA-Seq, impose tradeoffs between spatial resolution and multiplexing. more...

We first lysated the cell to release the RNA from the cell, then reverse transcripted the mRNA into cDNA, added polyA to the 3' end of cDNA, synthesized the second strand of cDNA used designed primer, and at last PCR amplified the double strand cDNA to get enough amount of DNA to construct the cDNA libraries.

We determine a novel transcriptional signature of the most invasive neural crest Trailblazer cells that is consistent during migration and enriched for approximately 900 genes. more...

364. Single Cell DNA Methylome Sequencing of Human Preimplantation Embryos
(Submitter supplied) Although the DNA methylome of human early embryos has been analyzed, some of the key features have not been addressed to date. Here, we performed single-cell DNA methylome sequencing for human preimplantation embryos and found that tens of thousands of genomic loci exhibited de novo DNA methylation. This finding indicates that genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming during preimplantation development is a dynamic balance between strong global demethylation and significant focused re-methylation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fibrosis is a common pathology in cardiovascular disease. In the heart, fibrosis causes mechanical and electrical dysfunction and in the kidney, it predicts the onset of renal failure. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGFβ1 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. more...

Despite its importance in the development of all animals, this pivotal genome-wide event remains poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected finding that oocyte global transcriptional silencing depends on an mRNA decay activator. Oocyte-specific loss of ZFP36L2—an RNA-binding protein critical for AU-rich element-mediated mRNA decay—prevents oocytes from undergoing global transcriptional silencing. more...

463. A single cell transcriptional roadmap for cardiopharyngeal fate diversification [scRNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Dynamic gene expression programs determine multipotent cell states and fate choices during development. Multipotent progenitors for cardiomyocytes and branchiomeric head muscles populate the pharyngeal mesoderm of vertebrate embryos, but the mechanisms underlying cardiopharyngeal multipotency and heart vs. head muscle fate choices remain elusive. The tunicate Ciona emerged as a simple chordate model to study cardiopharyngeal development with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. more...

496. Single cell RNA-seq data of human hESCs to evaluate SCnorm: robust normalization of single-cell rna-seq data
(Submitter supplied) Normalization of RNA-sequencing data is essential for accurate downstream inference, but the assumptions upon which most methods are based do not hold in the single-cell setting. Consequently, applying existing normalization methods to single-cell RNA-seq data introduces artifacts that bias downstream analyses. To address this, we introduce SCnorm for accurate and efficient normalization of scRNA-seq data.

(Submitter supplied) Human fetal germ cells (FGCs) are precursors to sperm and eggs and are crucial for maintenance of the species. However, the developmental trajectories and heterogeneity of human FGCs remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of over 2000 FGCs and their gonadal niche cells in female and male human embryos spanning several developmental stages. We found that the female FGCs undergo four distinct sequential phases characterized by mitosis, retinoic acid signaling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis. more...

505. Mapping karyotypic heterogeneity in chromosomal instable murine T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas using single-cell sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Chromosome instability (CIN) leads to aneuploidy and copy number variations (CNVs). Even though both are hallmarks of cancer cells, aneuploidy inhibits proliferation of untransformed cells, suggesting that cancer cells have adapted to cope with CIN. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents CIN by monitoring chromosome attachment and sister chromatid tension in mitosis. By conditionally inactivating Mad2, an essential SAC gene, we find that SAC inactivation in T-cells or hepatocytes is remarkably well tolerated and becomes tumorigenic when placed in a p53null or p53+/- predisposed background. more...

Successful cDNA synthesis and amplification was confirmed as reads mapped primarily to exons. It has to be noted though, that a comparision of cell to cell data is not possible as coverage of the whole transcriptome was too low, approximately <1.0x coverage. Nonetheless, RNA-seq data provided first information of highly abundant transcripts in individual human spermatogonia. more...

529. The Nature and Nurture of Cell Heterogeneity: Accounting for Macrophage Gene-environment Interactions with Single-cell RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) Background: Single-cell RNA-Seq can be a valuable and unbiased tool to dissect cellular heterogeneity, despite the transcriptome’s limitations in describing higher functional phenotypes and protein events. Perhaps the most important shortfall with transcriptomic ‘snapshots’ of cell populations is that they risk being descriptive, only cataloging heterogeneity at one point in time, and without microenvironmental context. more...

567. Laminin-guided highly efficient endothelial commitment from human pluripotent stem cells [Single Cell RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Obtaining highly purified differentiated cells via directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an essential step for the clinical application of hPSCs. Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified (>95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

We found that the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated in naïve culture conditions. Similar to cells of the blastocyst, resulting naive cells exhibited two active X-chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide transcriptional dampening, and initiated XIST-mediated X-inactivation upon differentiation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Genomic methods are used increasingly to interrogate the individual cells that compose specific tissues. However, current methods for single cell isolation struggle to phenotypically differentiate specific cells in a heterogeneous population and rely primarily on the use of fluorescent markers. Many cellular phenotypes of interest are too complex to be measured by this approach, making it difficult to connect genotype and phenotype at the level of individual cells. more...

615. Genetic Diversity Through RNA Editing: Apobec1-mediated RNA editing in bulk and single cell macrophages and dendritic cells
(Submitter supplied) RNA editing is a mutational mechanism that specifically alters the nucleotide content in sets of transcripts while leaving their cognate genomic blueprint intact. Editing has been detected from bulk RNA-seq data in thousands of distinct transcripts, but apparent editing rates can vary widely (from under 1% to almost 100%). These observed editing rates could result from approximately equal rates of editing within each individual cell in the bulk sample, or alternatively, editing estimates from a population of cells could reflect an average of distinct, biologically significant editing signatures that vary substantially between individual cells in the population. more...

628. Single-cell chromatin accessibility data using scATAC-seq
(Submitter supplied) A single hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to all blood cells with remarkable fidelity. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscape controlling this process in thirteen primary cell types that traverse the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that enhancer landscapes better reflect cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable "enhancer cytometry" for accurate enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. more...

629. Coupled electrophysiological recording and single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation
(Submitter supplied) The mammalian brain is heterogeneous, containing billions of neurons and trillions of synapses forming various neural circuitries, through which sense, movement, thought, and emotion are generated. The cellular heterogeneity of the brain has made it difficult to study the molecular logic of neural circuitry wiring, pruning, activation, and plasticity, until recently, transcriptome analyses with single-cell resolution makes decoding of gene regulatory networks underlying aforementioned circuitry properties possible. more...

Quantifying the abundance of this epigenetic mark at the single-cell level could enable us to understand its roles. We present a single-cell, genome-wide and strand-specific 5hmC sequencing technology based on 5hmC glucosylation and glucosylation-dependent digestion of DNA, that reveals pronounced cell-to-cell variability in the abundance of 5hmC on the two DNA strands of a given chromosome. more...

641. Innate-like functions of natural killer T cell subsets result from highly divergent gene programs [single_cell_RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Natural killer T (NKT) cells have immune stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the immune response that are context-dependent.  This may be attributed in part to the existence of functional NKT cell subsets; however, these functional subsets have only been characterized on the basis of differential expression of a few transcription factors and cell surface molecules.  Here we have analyzed purified populations of thymic NKT cell subsets at both the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels, and by single-cell RNA sequencing. more...

646. Distinct myeloid progenitor differentiation pathways uncovered through single cell RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question.    We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a seperation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

(Submitter supplied) Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) represents nearly 50% of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases with a 5-year overall survival of approximately 30%. In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. more...

The 3D transcriptome reveals that (i) the epiblast is partitioned into transcription domains corresponding to regions of epiblast where cells are endowed specifically with ectoderm and mesendoderm potency, (ii) novel lineage markers are identified as genes expressed in epiblast domains populated by cells displaying different lineage fates, (iii) functionally related gene regulatory circuitry and signaling pathways are acting in concert in the transcriptional domains, and (iv) the spatial information provides reference zipcodes for mapping the prospective address of cell samples from different embryos and stem cell lines. more...

The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown.  Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. more...

761. Single cell transcriptome analysis of mouse carotid body glomus cells
(Submitter supplied) The carotid body (CB) is a major arterial chemoreceptor containing glomus cells whose activities are regulated by changes in arterial blood contents including oxygen. We employed the single cell RNA­Seq method by performing next-generation sequencing on single glomus cell­derived cDNAs to eliminate contamination of genes derived from other cell types present in the CB. This study has generated a CB expression profile containing novel glomus cell specific genes. more...

763. Single Cell triple omics sequencing reveals genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Single cell genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome sequencing has been achieved separately. However, to analyze the regulation of RNA expression by genetic and epigenetic factors within an individual cell, it is necessary to analyze these omics simultaneously from the same single cell. Here we developed a single cell triple omics sequencing technique- scTrio-seq, to analyze the genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome concurrently of a mammalian cell.

768. Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA)
(Submitter supplied) The extent of transcriptional diversity in mouse NPCs is likely to be influenced by a variety of unexamined factors that include programmed cell death, genomic mosaicism as well as a variety of “environmental” influences such as changes in exposure to signaling lipids. We therefore used scRNA-seq to assess a cohort of cortical NPCs from an embryonic mouse. We demonstrate that PAGODA (Pathway And Geneset OverDispersion Analysis) effectively recovers the known neuroanatomical and functional organization of NPCs, identifying multiple aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity within the developing mouse cortex that are difficult to discern by the existing heterogeneity analysis approaches.

813. Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

(Submitter supplied) The molecular mechanism regulating phasic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from parvocellular neurons (PVN) remains poorly understood. Here, we find a cohort of parvocellular cells interspersed with magnocellular PVN neurons expressing secretagogin. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with protein interactome profiling identifies secretagogin neurons as a distinct CRH-releasing neuron population reliant on secretagogin’s Ca2+ sensor properties and protein interactions with the vesicular traffic and exocytosis release machineries to liberate this key hypothalamic releasing hormone.

Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required.

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell transcriptomics has recently emerged as a powerful technology to explore gene expression heterogeneity amongst single cells. Here we identify two major sources of technical variability, sampling noise and global cell-to-cell variation in sequencing efficiency. We propose noise models to correct for this and after validation by single-molecule FISH experiments, we apply these models to demonstrate that growing mES cells in 2i instead of serum/LIF globally reduces gene expression variability.

Here we describe a new method, ChrISP,which reproducibly scores for chromatin fiber proximities in 3D in single cells with a resolution of < 170 A. Moreover, ChrISP visualizes higher order structures of individual chromosomes in relation to structural hallmarks of interphase nuclei beyond the resolution of the light microscope.

We demonstrate that different stem/progenitor populations are characterised by distinctive TF expression states, and through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis reveal positively and negatively correlated TF pairings, including previously unrecognised relationships between Gata2, Gfi1 and Gfi1b. more...
