34. Identification of a mesenchymal progenitor cell hierarchy in adipose tissue (scRNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) The healthy growth of adipose tissue depends on the capacity of progenitor cells to undergo denovo adipogenesis. However, the cellular hierarchy and mechanisms governing adipocyteprogenitor differentiation are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a lineage hierarchy25 consisting of distinct mesenchymal cell types present in mouse and human adipose tissue. Cellsmarked by Dpp4 expression are highly proliferative, multipotent progenitors that give rise toIcam1+ committed pre-adipocytes and a related adipogenic population marked by Clec11a andCd142 expression. more...

36. Single cell RNAseq of human TCRVdelta 1 and TCRVdelta 2 gammadelta T lymphocytes purified from healthy adults blood
(Submitter supplied) γδ T lymphocytes represent ~1% of human PBMC and even more cells in most tissues of vertebrates. Although they have important anticancer functions, most current scRNA-Seq studies do not identify γδ T lymphocytes since their transcriptomes at the single cell level are unknown. Here we show that high resolution clustering of large scRNA-Seq data sets and a combination of gene signatures allow the specific detection of human γδ T lymphocytes and identification of their TCRVδ1 and TCRVδ2 subsets in large data sets from complex cell mixtures. more...

38. Single cell analysis of HSV-1 infection reveals anti-viral and developmental programs are activated in distinct sub-populations with opposite outcomes
(Submitter supplied) Viral infection is usually studied at the population level by averaging over millions of cells. However, infection at the single-cell level is highly heterogeneous, where most infected cells give rise to none or few viral progeny while some cells produce thousands. Analysis of HSV-1 infection by population averaged measurements has taught us a lot about the course of viral infection, but has also produced contradictory results, such as the concurrent activation and inhibition of type I interferon signaling during infection. more...

49. Defining reprogramming checkpoints from single cell analysis of induced pluripotency
(Submitter supplied) Elucidating the mechanism of reprogramming is confounded by heterogeneity due to the low efficiency and differential kinetics of obtaining induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells. Therefore we increased the efficiency with a novel combination of epigenetic and signaling molecules and profiled the transcriptomes of individual reprogramming cells. Contrary to the established temporal order, somatic gene inactivation and upregulation of cell cycle, epithelial and early pluripotency genes can be triggered independently such that any combination of these events co-occurs in single cells. more...

66. Single cell lineage tracing by endogenous mitochondrial DNA mutations in ATAC-seq data [HSC]
(Submitter supplied) Simultaneous measurement of lineage relationship and information on cell fate is desireable for human tissues. Here we describe a new strategy to track cell lineage using endogenous mitochondrial DNA variants in ATAC-seq data, which simultaneously measures the chromatin profiling. We first provide a proof of principle that somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome can be used as a genetic marker to depict cellular lineage relationships and further quantified the power of lineage definition with these genetic markers. more...

71. Defining the Activated Fibroblast Population in Lung Fibrosis Using Single Cell Sequencing
(Submitter supplied) In brief, we have applied a novel and unbiased approach to identify distinct and dynamic cell populations, including an in-depth analysis of the fibroblast population, in lung fibrosis. We found that while fibroblast number did not increase after injury, a population of activated fibroblasts can be identified in the fibrotic mouse lung. Using expression profiles of 1,945 lung fibroblasts we redefine the molecular characteristics of activated fibroblasts, finding that they are not a separate population but rather exhibit a similar, yet amplified, gene expression pattern to non-activated cells.

98. Gene regulatory network reconstruction using single-cell RNA sequencing of barcoded genotypes in diverse environments
(Submitter supplied) Understanding how gene expression programs are controlled requires identifying regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes. Gene regulatory networks are typically constructed from gene expression data acquired following genetic perturbation or environmental stimulus. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) captures the gene expression state of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment, offering advantages in combinatorial experimental design, large numbers of independent measurements, and accessing the interaction between the cell cycle and environmental responses that is hidden by population-level analysis of gene expression. more...

102. Cell composition analysis of bulk genomics using single cell data
(Submitter supplied) Single-cell expression profiling is a rich resource of cellular heterogeneity. While profiling every sample under study is advantageous, such workflow is time consuming and costly. We devised CPM - a deconvolution algorithm in which cellular heterogeneity is inferred from bulk expression data based on pre-existing collection of single-cell RNA-seq profiles. We applied CPM to investigate individual variation in heterogeneity of murine lung cells during in vivo influenza virus infection, revealing that the relations between cell quantities and clinical outcomes varies in a gradual manner along the cellular activation process. more...

105. Single cell RNA-seq identifies the origins of heterogeneity in efficient cell transdifferentiation and reprogramming.
(Submitter supplied) Some somatic cells are plastic, having the capacity to convert into other specialized cells (transdifferentiation) or into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, reprogramming) in response to transcription factor over-expression. To explore what makes a cell plastic and whether susceptibility to different cell conversion processes is coupled, we exposed bone marrow derived pre-B cells to two different transcription factor protocols that efficiently convert them either into macrophages (iMac) or iPS cells, and monitored the two processes over time using single cell gene expression analysis.

113. Single-cell analysis of homeostatic and regenerative adult skeletal muscle stem cells
(Submitter supplied) Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) ensure the formation and homeostasis of skeletal muscle and are responsible for its growth and repair processes. For repair to occur, MuSCs must exit from quiescence, abandon their niche and asymmetrically and symmetrically divide to reconstitute the stem cell pool and give rise to muscle progenitors, respectively. The transcriptomes of pooled MuSCs have provided a rich source of information for describing the genetic programs underlying distinct static cell states; however, bulk microarray and RNA-seq afford only averaged gene expression profiles, which blur the heterogeneity and developmental dynamics of asynchronous MuSC populations. more...

(Submitter supplied) Lineage tracing provides unprecedented insights into the fate of individual cells and their progeny in complex organisms. While effective genetic approaches have been developed in vitro and in animal models, these cannot be used to interrogate human physiology in vivo. Instead, naturally occurring somatic mutations have been utilized to infer clonality and lineal relationships between cells in human tissues, but current approaches are limited by high error rates and scale, and provide little information about the state or function of the cells. more...

133. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals AML hierarchies relevant to disease progression and immunity
(Submitter supplied) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that resides within a complex microenvironment, complicating efforts to understand how different cell types contribute to disease progression. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. more...

(Submitter supplied) This analysis represents the first comprehensive sampling of germ cells in the developing testis over time, at high-resolution, single-cell depth. From these analyses, we have not only revealed novel genetic regulatory signatures of murine germ cells over time, but have also demonstrated that cell types positive for a single marker gene have the capacity to change dramatically during testis maturation, and therefore cells of a particular “identity” may differ significantly from postnatal to adult life.

(Submitter supplied) Plexiform neurofibroma is a major contributor to morbidity in Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) patients. Macrophages and mast cells infiltrate neurofibroma, and data from mouse models implicate these leukocytes in neurofibroma development. Anti-inflammatory therapy targeting these cell populations has been suggested as a means to prevent neurofibroma development. Here, we compare gene expression in inflamed nerves from NF1 models which invariably form neurofibroma to those with inflammation driven by EGFR overexpression which rarely progresses to neurofibroma. more...

193. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of Arabidopsis roots
(Submitter supplied) We report the use of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gene expression in wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis root cells.  We demonstrate that using a commercially available platform for droplet-based scRNA-seq (10X Genomics Chromium) enables transcriptional profiling of individual protoplasts representing all of the major cell/tissue types of the root.  Furthermore, rare cell types and subtypes have been identified.  These single-cell transcriptomes were also used to generate a pseudotime series for the root hair and non-hair cell differentiation pathways.  In addition, scRNA-seq was used to define and compare transcriptomes from root epidermis mutants, which enabled a detailed molecular analysis of the mutant phenotype.  This study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a gene expression map at single-cell resolution for the Arabidopsis root.

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within many organisms but few methods have been developed for microbial clonal populations. The yeast genome displays an unusually dense transcript spacing with interleaved and overlapping transcription from both strands, resulting in a minuscule but complex pool of RNA protected by a resilient cell wall. Here, we developed a sensitive, scalable and inexpensive yeast single-cell RNA-seq (yscRNA-seq) method that digitally counts transcript start sites (TSS) in a strand- and isoform-specific manner with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). more...

212. Single-cell profiling of the myeloid landscape identifies cell subsets with distinct fates during neuroinflammation
(Submitter supplied) The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages. However, this complexity is increased in inflammatory settings by the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells. It is unclear which disease-specific myeloid subsets exist and what their transcriptional profiles and dynamics during CNS pathology are. By combining deep single-cell transcriptome analysis, fate mapping, in vivo imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic lines, we comprehensively characterized unappreciated myeloid subsets in several CNS compartments during neuroinflammation. During inflammation, CNS macrophage subsets undergo self-renewal, and random proliferation shifted towards clonal expansion. Finally, functional studies demonstrated that endogenous CNS tissue macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. Our results highlight myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain’s innate immune system.

232. Extensive cellular heterogeneity of X inactivation revealed by single-cell allele-specific expression in human fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) provides a dosage compensation mechanism where, in each female cell, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly silenced. However, some genes on the inactive X  chromosome and outside the pseudoautosomal regions escape from XCI and are expressed from both alleles (escapees). We investigated XCI at single-cell resolution combining deep single cellRNA sequencing with whole-genome sequencing to examine allelic-specific expression in 935 primary fibroblast and 48 lymphoblastoid single cells from five female individuals. more...

294. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals estrogen signaling augments the mitochondrial folate pathway to coordinately fuel purine and polyamine synthesis in breast cancer cells (T47D)
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen regulates diverse physiological effects and drives breast tumor progression by directly activating the estrogen receptor α (ERα). However, due to the stochastic nature of gene transcription and the resulting heterogeneous cellular responses, it is important to investigate estrogen-stimulated gene expression profiles at the single-cell level in order to fully understand how ERα regulates transcription in breast cancer cells. more...

304. Characterization of human mosaic Rett syndrome brain tissue by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (Single-cell or single-nuclei RNA sequencing)
(Submitter supplied) In females with X-linked genetic disorders, wild-type and mutant cells coexist within brain tissue because of random X-chromosome inactivation. This cellular mosaicism leads to phenotypic variability and poses significant challenges for interpreting the effects of X-linked mutant alleles on gene expression. We present a single-nucleus RNA sequencing approach that resolves mosaicism by using single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that are expressed in cis with the X-linked mutation to determine whether individual nuclei express the wild-type or mutant allele even when the mutant gene is not directly detected. more...

329. 10x Genonics single-cell RNA-seq of immature (P6) ID4-EGFP mouse spermatogonia & testis cells
(Submitter supplied) To reveal distinct transcriptomes associated with spermatogonial stem cell renewal vs. initiation of differentiation, single-cell transcriptomes from P6 ID4-EGFP+ spermatogonia (sorted for brightest or dimmest) or unselected testis cells were used for Drop-Seq analysis. The GFP-bright and dim phenotypes exhibit distinct fates when assayed by transplantation, with ID4-EGFPbright cells highly enriched for SSCs, and ID4-EGFPdim cells enriched for progenitors. more...

334. Stem cell differentiation trajectories in Hydra resolved at single cell resolution
(Submitter supplied) The adult Hydra polyp continuously renews all of its cells using three separate stem cell populations but the genetic pathways enabling these dynamic tissue properties are not well understood. We used Drop-seq to sequence 25,052 Hydra cells and identified the molecular signatures of a broad spectrum of cell states, from stem cells to terminally differentiated cells. We constructed differentiation trajectories for each cell lineage and identified the transcription factors expressed along these trajectories, thus creating a comprehensive map of all developmental lineages in the adult animal. more...

335. Rainbow-seq: combining cell division lineage tracking with single-cell RNA sequencing for understanding cell fate decision in preimplantation development
(Submitter supplied) Our main question is whether there are reproducible cell-to-cell transcriptome differences in 4-cell embryos that are attributable to their different progenitor cells at the 2-cell stage. If the answer is negative, we wish to test whether there are reproducible cell-to-cell transcriptome differences in 8-cell embryos that are attributable to their different progenitor cells at the 2-cell stage. To address these questions, we developed the Rainbow-seq method that uses fluorescent protein genes to trace cell divisions in preimplantation embryonic development (PED) embryos

336. scFTD-seq: freeze-thaw lysis based, portable approach toward highly distributed single-cell 3’ mRNA profiling
(Submitter supplied) We present sc-FTDseq, a microchip platform for single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3’ mRNA sequencing. It offers format flexibility with a much simplified, widely adoptable workflow that reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time, with the quality of data and the cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq platforms. Freeze-thaw, known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in RNA fragmentation, turns out to be fully compatible with single-cell 3’ mRNA sequencing, which detects only ~50 bases at the 3’ end. more...

337. Use single cell RNA sequencing to study the molecular siganature of primary human Megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor
(Submitter supplied) Megakaryocytic-Erythroid Progenitors (MEP) produce circulating red blood cells and platelets. Although much is known regarding megakaryocytic (Mk) and erythroid (E) maturation, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the MEP fate decision have not been determined. Single cell RNA sequencing of highly enriched populations of primary human common myeloid progenitors (CMP), MEP, megakaryocyte progenitors (MKP) and erythroid progenitors (ERP), revealed that MEP have a distinct molecular signature with co-expression of genes otherwise expressed exclusively in CMP, MKP or ERP. more...

338. Gene expression profiles of isogenic single-cell derived clones of BRAF-mutated SK-MEL-5 melanoma cell lines
(Submitter supplied) We recently reported that single-cell derived isogenic subclones of SKMEL5 cells have differential initial sensitivity to BRAF-inhibitors. In order to probe differences among these subclones, we selected three subclones with unique drug responses: progressing (SK-MEL-5 SC10), stationary (SK-MEL-5 SC07), and regressing (SK-MEL-5 SC01) and performed RNASeq. This study examines differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the subclones to identify the molecular basis for initial differences in drug sensitivity.

339. Single-cell RNA-seq of melanoma ecosystems reveals sources of T cells exclusion linked to immunotherapy clinical outcomes
(Submitter supplied) Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) from 31 melanoma tumors and novel computational methods to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T cell exclusion and immune evasion. more...
